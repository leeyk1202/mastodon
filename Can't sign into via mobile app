I'm u able to sign in via the mobile apps.

I've tried multuple mo ile apps and really hate having to ise mobile browsers.   But every time i try the mastadon.cmastadon.cloud domain fails
My account is on mastadon.cmastadon.cloud and I'm not willing to change it since my discord server members also use mastadon.cmastadon.cloud. im planning to use it to benefit my discord a bit more.

Currently I'm trying to login via Mastalabs. Ut am still not able to.

I'm on a Stock Non-Root Sprint LG V20 with Android 8.0

Any help would be much appreciated.

If I can't run it via the app I'll be deleting my account since mobile browsers really strike a nerve with me.


Someone please help me with this. Every time I try I vet an errir claiming there's mastadon.cmastadon.cloud is not a valid instance.

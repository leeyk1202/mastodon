<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

<p>We're contacting you to notify you that two-factor authentication was disabled for your account on <%= @instance %>. Your account is now protected only by your password.</p>

<p>If you did not disable two-factor authentication yourself, it is likely that someone has gained access to your account. Please change your password and re-enable two-factor authentication immediately or contact the instance admin if you're locked out of your account.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<p>

<p>The <%= @instance %> team</p>

Hello <%= @resource.email %>!

We're contacting you to notify you that the backup recovery codes you use on <%= @instance %> were regenerated. Recovery codes allow you to regain access to your account if you lose your phone.

If you did not regenerate your recovery codes, it is likely that someone has gained access to your account. Please change your password and reset your two-factor authentication settings immediately or contact the instance admin if you're locked out of your account.

Sincerely,

The <%= @instance %> team
